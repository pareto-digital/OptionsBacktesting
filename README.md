Between Jan. 2016 to June 2021, total return of the strategy is $66,400 (excl. commision fees), and maximum drawdown (loss) of $1,300 in March 2020. The average buying power effect (similar to the concept of collatoral), was only $1,0000+, resulting an ROI of 500%+.

We compare this strategy with holding 100 shares of SPY. The purchasing cost was $20,000 in Jan. 2016. During the same period, SPY rised from $2000 to $400, a ROI of 100% and max draw down of $10,000+ in March 2020.

The options strategy is strictly better than buy&hold SPY.
