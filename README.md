# OptionsBacktesting
We used our tool to backtest 7dte put creadit spread strategy on SPX. Total return of the strategy is $66,400 between Jan. 2016 to June 2021, a more than 500%+ ROI, and maximum draw down of $1,300 in March 2020. The average buying power effect (similar to the concept of collatoral), was only $1,0000+.
We compare this strategy with holding 100 shares of SPY, which requires $20,000 to purchase in Jan. 2016. During the same period, SPY rised from $2000 to $400 , a ROI of 100% and max draw down of $10,000+ in March 2020.
