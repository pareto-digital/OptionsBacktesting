Between Jan. 2016 to June 2021, total return of the strategy is $66,400 (not consider commision fees), and maximum drawdown was $1,300 in March 2020. The average buying power effect was only $1,0000+, resulting an ROI of 500%+.

We compare this strategy with holding 100 shares of SPY. The purchasing cost was $20,000 in Jan. 2016. During the same period, SPY rised from $200 to $400 (100% ROI) and max draw down of $10,000+ in March 2020.

The options strategy is strictly better than buy&hold SPY.
